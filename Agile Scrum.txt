Project management is a discipline 
	-Planning
	-Organizing
	-Motivating
	-Control of resources.
Project Management acieves a specific goal:
	There are 5 development components of a project:
		-initiation
		-planning and design
		-execution & construction
		-montioring and controlling systems
		-completing

Traditional PM
Waterfall Model
--> Requirement gatering - -> Design --> Development --> integration -->Testing.

Why no waterfall model ?
-Makes changes difficulty.
-doesnot focus on the end-suer/client.
-The testing phase is delayed unitl most of the project is completed.
-Measuring the progrocess within the stage is difficult.

Agile is a set of principle used in project management and software development

4 main points: 
-It enables teams to deilver value to thier customer with ease.
-Agile teams deliver work in samll, but usable increments,
-Evaluation of the requirements , plans, and results take place continuously. This allows teams to respnd to changes quickely.

Agile Manifesto (Feb 2001)
we value these more than the item on the below(5-8)
1) Individual and interactions.
2) working porducts
3) Customer Collaboration
4) Responsding to changes

we value these,but not as much as the item on the top(1-4)
5) Processes and Tools
6) Comprehensive Documentation
7) Contract Negotiation
8) Following a plan.


Agile Manifesto Principles
Principle 1: Customer satisfaction --> You need to satisfy customer thri=ough early and quick delivery of the products.
Principle 2: Accomadating Changes ---> customers changing needs to be addressed even late in the development.
Principle 3: Deliver Frequently ---> Ensure software is delivered frequently, focusing on a shoter timescale.
Principle 4: Work Together ---> Developers and business individuals need to work together through the course of project
Principle 5: Motivated Team: Project need to be built around motivated individual and they must be trusted to get the job done.
Principle 6:Face to face Interaction ---> Face to face conversition is the most efficient means of communication
Principle 7: Working Software ---> Working progress is a primary measure of progress (means not to give a hypothetical software, we must give working s/w).
Principle 8: Constant pace ---> The agile process promotes sustainable development
Principle 9: Good Design ---> Agility can be improved by focusing on technical excellence and good design
Principle 10: Simplicity ---> The amount of work which is not being done should be minimized.
Principle 11: self-organization ---> self organized teams provide the best architecture , requirements and design
Principle 12:  Reflect and Adjust ---> Effectiveness can be imporved by the team regularly reflecting on it.


Agile methods: 
--> Lean --> Lean is a set of tools and principles that aims to identify and remove waste to increase th speed of process development.It focuses on maximizing value of client 
--> kANBAN. --> This mehod is ued to design , manage and improve the flow of system. Organizations can visualise their flow of work and limiting their work in progress.
--> Extreme programming (XP) --> It is a framework that enables teams to create high quality s/w and imporve their quality of life.
--> Crystal --> It is an approach to software development that foucses on people and thier interactions , rather than tools and process. It is aimed to streamline process and imporve optimization.
--> DSDM
--> FDD
--> TDD

Scrum Scalability
=================
Effective scrum team are 6-10 members

What is Agile? Agile is aset of methods and practices that focuses on iterative development.

Scrum Principle
===============
-> Empirical Process Control
-> Self-organization
-> collaboration
-> vlaue based Prioritization
-> Time boxing
-> Iterative Development


-> Empirical Process Control
	Empirical process control in scrum is a way of managing work that is based on observation and experimentation, rather than predefined plans and processes. 
	It allows scrum teams to be flexible and adaptive in the face of change, by learning from their experiences and making adjustments as needed. 
	Empirical process control relies on three pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Transparency means presenting the facts as they are, 
	without hiding or manipulating information.

A scrum team consist if 3 roles: 
	-> The scrum master, 
	-> The product owner and 
	-> The development team.


SCRUM PHASES:
=============

1) Initiate 
2) Plan & Estimate
3) Implement
4) Review & Retrospect
5) Release

1) Initiate: 

	During this phase, the team will create the project's vision, essentially outlining a roadmap with the main objectives, goals, and deliverables. 
	They will also identify all stakeholders, assign team members to each role, and determine epics forming the project backlog. 

	The product backlog is a list that contains features (product epics) that will be implemented during development, ordered by priority. 
	A Product Owner creates these based on the project’s vision and the client’s needs, and they’re usually formatted.


2) Plan & Estimate: 

	Product epics are rarely accomplished with just one task or feature. 
	To achieve the goals of a product epic, the Scrum team would have to complete several actions. 
	These are called user stories.

	User stories are formatted in the same way product epics are formatted. However, they are typically quicker to implement.

3) Implement:

	The implementation phase is about the execution of tasks and activities to accomplish product goals and complete project deliverables.
	Scrum processes that are key to this phase are daily stand-up meetings and burndown chart monitoring.
	Daily stand-up meetings are regular (but quick) touch bases that the team does to check on task status, align on sprint progress, and check for possible issues. 

4) Review & Retrospect: 

	The review & retrospective phase is an essential part of the agile scrum process and should be done after every sprint ends. 
	It's an opportunity to evaluate what was successful, what could be improved, and how to move forward by gathering customer feedback and team insights. 

5) Release :

	The Release phase is the final phase of the Scrum methodology steps and is all about getting the final project deliverables ready and turning them over to the relevant stakeholders. 
	Here, the team needs to ensure that all their hard work is rewarded with a successful completion.

SECTION 4: CHAPTER 3 - INITIATING A PROJECT.
--------------------------------------------
1) Scrum Cycle - Initiate

Business Case -----> Vision Statement -----> Prioritized Product Backlog.
	=>Create Project Vision—In this process, the Project Business Case is reviewed to create a Project Vision Statement that will serve as the inspiration and provide focus for the entire project. 
	  The Product Owner is identified in this process.

2) Create the project Vision: 
	=>A business case triggers a Scrum project.
	Tools inculded : 
		->Project vision meetings.
		->JAD sessions
		->SWOT analysis
		->Gap analysis.
	=>A vision describes a set of outcomes.

3)Project Vision Meeting
	=>To engage with appropriate stakeholder,

4)JAD Sessions:
	=> A JAD session is a Joint Application Development (or Design) session where stakeholders with different points of view come together 
	   to understand business requirements and brainstorm the best technical approach for meeting the customer's needs.

5) GAP Analysis: 
	=> A gap analysis is a valuable tool used to compare your current state with your desired future state. By identifying gaps between the two,
	    you can develop actionable goals to improve your business performance.



Identifying the Scrum Master.
=============================

Identify the Scrum Master.
-----------------------------
=>The scrum master is intended to be a servant leader of the scrum team and other stakeholder in the project.
=>The objective of scrum master is to moderate & facilitate team interaction & coach and mentor the various stakeholder and
   try to produce valuable outcome for the customers.
=> S Master teaches and reinforces scrum principles

Identify the Stakeholder
-------------------------
Scrum describe roles as Core and Non-core.
	Core roles are :
	- Product owner
	- Scrum Master
	- Scrum Team

	Non-core roles include
	- Stakeholder
	   * customers
	   * users
	   * sponsers
	- Venors
	- Scrum Guidance Body

Form the Scrum Team
-------------------
- Once the Scrum master and the stake holder is identified.Next step is team Formation.
- Scrum teams are cross functional.
- Key skills : 
	* independent thinking
	* self-motivation
	* customer-focused
	* responsible
	* collaborative

-Typical scrum team is 6-10 people.

Tuckman's model
-Formin
-Stroming
-Norming
-Performing


=> Develop Epics :
 Developing epics is a way of organizing your product backlog into large, high-level features that 
 deliver user value and align with your strategic goals. Epics can be broken down into smaller user 
 stories that can be completed in a single sprint. Epics help you prioritize, plan, and track your 
 progress across multiple sprints and teams.

EPICS & PERSONAE
----------------

Epic tell a story. what would the customer and user like to happen ?

Personae describe an example bringing the connection to life.

Create the Prioritized Product Backlog
--------------------------------------
=> Prioritized product backlog: a prioritized list of epics, user stories,changes and perhaps risk to be managed during project.
=> Prdouct woner : develops and maintains the prioritized product backlog.
=> Scrum master may facilitate user griup workshop or focus groups to help prioritize options.
* Techniques used to prioritize the product backlog : 
	1) MoSCow Analysis
	2) Paired Comparisons
	3) 100 Point Method
	4) Kano Analysis


1) MoSCow Analysis
------------------
M-Must have
S-Should have
C-Could have
W-Wont have


2) Paired Comparisons	
------------------------
-List all the user stories
-compare then, two at a time.
-Keeping going until all the user stories are prioritized.

3) 100 Point Method
--------------------
-Each user get 100 points to vote for user stories and then they are prioritized.

4) Kano Analysis
------------------
classifies features as 
-Exciters/Delighters
-Satisfiers
-Dissatifiers
-Indifferent. 

Conduct Release Planning
=========================
Deliver high value functionality to the customer sooner rather than.
-Release Strategies:
  ->Continous Delpoyment - featured centered
  -> Phased Deployment - time centered

Output of Release Planning:
===========================
Release planning schedule usually evolves as the project progresses.

Length of sprint.
---> Most Scrum practices maxout at 4 weeks.
	* some last 6 weeks
	* Many prefer shorter sprint of 2 or 3 weeks.
---> Define target customers for a release.

CHAPTER-4 : PLANNING & ESTIMATING A PROJECT
===========================================
Plan and Estimate
------------------
Prioritized Product Backlog ==> sprint backlog ==> Release planning schedule ==> Daily Starup ==> Creat Deliverables ==> Groom product Backlog.



Point cost estimation
---------------------
-uses story points, not monetary units.
-Estimation technique in relative terms.

Other Estimation Tecniques:
---------------------------
-> Bandwidth Delphi
-> Relative Sizing/Story Points
-> Affinity Estimation
-> Estimation Ranges

Index cards: 
-> user stories are written on small index cards.
-> only esential details are documented.
-> Index cards: 
	* Facilitates collaboration and discussion.
	* Inscrease visibility and transperency.
	* reduce risk and assist with problem determination.

Dependencies: Breaking the task into pecies.
Determining dependencies: Once the task are identified , consider technical & people dependencies.
-> Mandatory dependecies.
-> Discretionary dependencies.
-> External Dependencies.
-> Internal Dependencies.

==> Sprint backlog takes input from:
 -committed user stories.
 -changes
 -risks
 - effort estimated task list.
